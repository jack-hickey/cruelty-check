						heading="So what <em>is</em> Cruelty Check?">
						<p>
							Cruelty Check is a community-driven project that makes it easier to discover whether the products you use are vegan and/or cruelty-free. By searching for a product, you can quickly see details about its ethical status, from animal testing practices to Fair Trade certification.</p>

						<p>
							All of the information on Cruelty Check comes from community submissions, from people like you! When new products are submitted, the information is moderated and reviewed before being approved and made visible to everyone.
						</p>

						<p>
							For stricter vegans, it's important to consider not just the ingredients of a product, but also the practices of the companies behind them. This is often one of the hardest parts of living a vegan lifestyle, but Cruelty Check makes it easier. When relevant, brand information is included. For example, if a product is vegan and cruelty-free but its parent company tests on animals, you'll be able to see that.</p>

						<p>
							Feedback is always welcome, and you'll find several ways to share it. You can use the feedback button at the top of the page to report an issue, suggest an improvement, or simply say thanks! You can also flag a product if you believe some information may be incorrect. And of course, new product submissions are encouraged, once they're reviewed and approved, they'll appear on the site for everyone to use.</p>

						<p>
							Privacy is important, and Cruelty Check's aim is simply to provide an easy access route into the vegan world, so why would it use cookies? It doesn't! Cruelty Check doesn't use cookies or trackers in any capacity, and doesn't collect any personal data when you visit the site.

						<p>
							This site uses Cloudflare to keep it nice and fast for you (and more importantly, secure). This means some basic, non-personal information may be processed temporarily for security but it is never stored and we don't use it in any shape or form.

						<p>
							Please note that while submissions are provided in good faith by the amazing community and are reviewed and moderated, the information may not always be 100% accurate. For complete certainty, you are encouraged to check official sources.
